- What did you struggle with in this section?

1. This may have been one of the only assignments that came easier to me! I did productively struggle and ask groupmates to run in the terminal as some of the syntax in the file created an error.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

2. I find that during lecture I simply want to listen.. however when pre-reading assignments I highlight some areas that come less easy to make sure I am paying extra attention during lecture.

For me, that is absolutely massive-- comfortability on the tennis court, comfortability in the surf-- there is always a moment when you just let go and do your best. I've been telling myself that all week... but I think I've really had a breakthrough with that coder mentality of "theres always an answer..."
